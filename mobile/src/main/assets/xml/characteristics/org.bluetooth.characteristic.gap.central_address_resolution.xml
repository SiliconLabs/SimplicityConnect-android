        <Summary>
            The Peripheral checks if the peer device supports address resolution by reading the
            Central Address Resolution characteristic before using directed advertisement where the
            initiator address is set to a Resolvable Private Address (RPA).

    <Note>
        <p>
            A device has only one instance of the Central Address Resolution characteristic. If the
            Central Address Resolution characteristic is not present, then it is assumed that
            Central Address Resolution is not supported.
